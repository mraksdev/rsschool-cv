## Code examples

### Python

1.Task is to make a function that can take any non-negative integer as an argument and return it with its digits in descending order. Essentially, rearrange the digits to create the highest possible number.

```Python
def descending_order(num):
    return int("".join(sorted([num for num in str(num)], reverse=True)))
```

2.Check to see if a string has the same amount of 'x's and 'o's. The method must return a boolean and be case insensitive. The string can contain any char.

```Python
def xo(s):
    s = s.lower()
    return s.count('x') == s.count('o')
```
